# light-control 

This is a simple Quarkus project which was originally planned and designed as a more advanced demo for the features of Quarkus: REST client, REST easy service, Qute, Panache, OpenShift and Image creation.

## Description
If you have more than one Hue Bridge in your Home Automation, you might now that you need to switch between bridges if you want to turn on/off lights in for example 1st floor and 2nd floor. 

This project can use several bridges and provides one big database with all rooms and lights in it. If you want to turn on/off a light or a room you don't have to worry about the bridge it belongs to. 

light-control also comes with a simple UI

## API
All API calls are relative to `/api/` and are generated by `org.wanja.hue.PublicApiResource.java`

## UI
All UI calls are relative to `/ui/` and are generated via Qute by `org.wanja.hue.render.PublicRenderResource.java`.

The main qute template is `src/main/resources/templates/index.html`. It includes other content templates based on state (`favorites.html`, `room.html`). It also makes use of `javascript.txt` template.
